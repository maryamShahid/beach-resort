# Beach Resort üèñÔ∏è

## Hotel Database Management System

Beach Resort is a full-stack application for a hotel database management system using React.js for frontend, Spring Boot for backend and MariaDB for the database.

A web-based project designed to allow user access to a hotel. The users consist of guests, employees and candidates. Guests are able to book a room in whichever building and location they prefer, rate and make comments on their reservations, order food from various restaurants depending on the availability of food and buy tickets for a plethora of events being conducted at the hotel, such as activities, group tours, pool parties etc. Employees consist of managers, housekeepers, security staff and recruiters. The system allows them to access their role-specific features. Managers are able to assign tasks to other employees - food orders for delivery and cleaning duties to housekeepers and buildings for security walks to security staff. They can also initiate events - guest activities, group tours, training programs - in various locations of the hotel. The system also gives them the authority to accept or reject applications for training programs and leave requests. Similarly, housekeepers are assigned cleaning duties to various rooms and deliver food to guests. Recruiters are able to view candidate applications, just as candidates are allowed to apply for available positions in the hotel. All the employees are allowed to fill a leave request form by checking their annual leave.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
